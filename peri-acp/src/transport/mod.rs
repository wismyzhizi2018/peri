//! Transport abstraction for ACP JSON-RPC 2.0 bidirectional communication.
//!
//! The [`AcpTransport`] trait provides a unified interface for sending requests,
//! notifications, and responses, and for receiving incoming messages. Two
//! implementations are provided:
//!
//! - [`MpscTransport`](mpsc) — in-memory channel pair for TUI ↔ ACP Server
//! - [`StdioTransport`](stdio) — stdio-based transport for external IDE clients
